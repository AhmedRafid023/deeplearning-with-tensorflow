# 🧠 Computer Vision Project with Deep Learning & TensorFlow

This repository contains a deep learning-based computer vision project implemented using TensorFlow and trained in Google Colab. The goal of this project is to **[describe your objective, e.g., classify images, detect objects, etc.]**.

## 🚀 Features

- TensorFlow-based deep learning model
- Google Colab for training and experimentation
- Custom data preprocessing and augmentation pipeline
- Visualization of training metrics and predictions
- Easy to customize and extend

## 📁 Project Structure


## 🗂️ Dataset

- **Dataset Used:** [Dataset name, e.g., CIFAR-10, COCO, Custom Dataset]
- **Source:** [Link or source of the dataset]
- **Preprocessing:** Images are resized to [e.g., 224x224], normalized, and augmented (e.g., flips, rotations)

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- Base Model: [e.g., CNN, ResNet50, MobileNetV2]
- Layers: [e.g., Conv2D, Dropout, BatchNorm, Dense]
- Loss Function: [e.g., Categorical Crossentropy, MSE]
- Optimizer: [e.g., Adam, SGD]
- Evaluation Metrics: [e.g., Accuracy, IoU]
